# Government Procurement Data Analysis and Dashboard

This repository contains the work done on a Government Procurement Data Analysis project, where the objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize procurement data using Power BI. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes detailed records of government procurement processes, suppliers, and contract details, which were analyzed to uncover trends, anomalies, and insights.
Key Features:

    Data Cleaning and Transformation: The raw dataset was cleaned and processed to ensure it was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This involved handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing formats.
    Data Analysis: Various data analysis techniques were applied to explore procurement trends, supplier performance, contract types, and budget utilization.
    Interactive Power BI Dashboard: An intuitive Power BI dashboard was created to present key insights and allow users to interactively explore the data. The dashboard includes visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to track procurement metrics.

Objective:

The goal of this project was to provide actionable insights from the government procurement process, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data-driven trends and performance indicators.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and interact with the dashboard to gain deeper insights into the procurement data.
